					<p>This is where the chapter ends A new one now begins Time has come for letting go
					The hardest part is when you know All of these years, when we were here
					Are ending, but I'll always remember	We have had the time of our lives
					Now the page is turned The stories we will write We have had the time of our lives
					And I will not forget The faces left behind It's hard to walk away From the best of days
					But if it has to end I'm glad you have been my friend In the time of our lives
					Where the water meets the land	There is shifting in the sand Like the tide that ebbs and flows
					Memories will come and go All of these years When we were here
					Are ending But I'll always remember We have had the time of our lives
					Now the page is turned The stories we will write We have had the time of our lives
					And I will not forget The faces left behind It's hard to walk away From the best of days
					But if it has to end I'm glad you have been my friendIn the time of our lives
